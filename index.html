<h1>About Charles</h1>

<p>I'm 27, from Albuquerque, and used to work in non-profit accounting in Seattle.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to move back to the PNW in the next year or so because I miss the rain.</p>
<p>I'm a self-taught master coder, and decided to take this course for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I was in the area and figured, "why not?"</li>
    <li>To prove to my rival, Anonymous (who was too scared to even take this bootcamp), that I am the true MASTER CODER</li>
</ol>
