  <h1>About Charles</h1>
<div>
    <p>I'm 27, from Albuquerque, and used to work in non-profit accounting in Seattle.</p>
    <p>I'm hoping to move back to the PNW in the next year or so because I miss the rain.</p>
    <p>I'm a self-taught master coder, and decided to take this course for two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I was in the area and figured, "why not?"</li>
        <li>To prove to my rival, Anonymous (who was too scared to even take this bootcamp), that I am the true MASTER CODER</li>
    </ol>
